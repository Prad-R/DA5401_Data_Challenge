# Problem Statement

The primary goal is to predict the fitness of a metric given a prompr-response pair generated by an LLM.

This is what is done in the notebook `da5401-data-challenge.ipynb`.

# Some Notes

- The notebook has been downloaded from my Kaggle submission, and hence has a few paths that need to be changed according to the file system of the user.

- The notebook requires a Hugging Face token to access the mpnet embedding model. GitHub doesn't allow me to push my own code, so the user must use their own token for the same.
